# Introduction to Statistical Learning

I mainly used Python for the end of chapter exercises.

The libraries used are listed below:
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Seaborn

I'm using [Anaconda/Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.anaconda.com/) to code and am using the 2nd edition of their 1st printed version.
You can access this edition [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLRv2_website.pdf).
