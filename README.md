# Introduction to Statistical Learning

The bulk of the exercises in the book are coded in the language R. However, I decided to use Python for the end of chapter exercises. For each chapter, I have a folder 
with 2 files. One file for conceptual exercises and another for applied exercises. Aside from the chapter folders, I have a folder titled Files that holds
the data needed to complete the applied exercises.

The libraries used are listed below:
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Seaborn

I'm using [Anaconda/Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.anaconda.com/) to code and am using the 2nd edition of their 1st printed version.
